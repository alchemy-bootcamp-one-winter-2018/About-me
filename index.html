        <h2>Here are some facts about mine:</h2>
          <p>I have a Bulldog/Bull Terrier Mix--</p>
          <p>His name is Journey.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>He just loves every person, dog, and cat he meets!</li>
                <li>His head is enormous! And covered in wrinkles.</li>
                <li>He sometimes has a habit of chewing on things he shouldn't.</li>
              </ol>
          <p>I have a Cornsnake-</p>
          <p>Her name is Opalescence.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Cornsnakes can live up to 25 years in captivity!</li>
                <li>Opal isn't very good at constricting, so I have to feed her pre-frozen rats.</li>
                <li>She is a complete albino, or Snow Morph, and it gives her lovely pink eyes and cream scales. </li>
              </ul>
